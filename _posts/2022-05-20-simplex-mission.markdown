# Mission Contact ISS

## Best time to operate

Ideal times to make contact an atronaut on simplex is an hour after wakeup and an hour before sleep which is 0830 and 1830 UTC, respectively.  So, for me, just after lunch time is a good time to operate and attempt contact during one of theses time frames.  During the weekends the time frame opens to possible operating times any time between 0730 and 1930 UTC.

However, my first goal is to make a contact operatig the IORS cross-band repeater. Below are resources to check for the latest status of the radio onboard the ISS, since they often turn it off for other operations and a link to track and plan when the ISS will be in orbit over my location.
