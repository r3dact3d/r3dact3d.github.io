## Summer of '22

Being recently licensed and still getting used to talking on the radio I started working on setting up a base station to practice checking into local Nets on 2 meters.  In the DFW area there are nets multiple times a day I could potentially check-into.

I'm also able to work from home currently and with gas prices almost $4 a gallon and high temps breaking records, portable and mobile operations are minimal.  Also, generally I just enjoy monitoring VHF/UHF national calling frequencies.

I decided to research my signal coverage and found Radio Mobile Online by ve2dbe and plugged in my antenna information.

The first image attempts to show the areas in green that would have a signal strength of at least S4 when I'm using base station at 25watts and the receiving station has an antenna around 2 meters high, which is average mobile antenna height. 

Areas in yellow, especially if outside of the metroplex, may still get great reception at s2 or s3 however, within my neighborhood the noise level is often right at s3

The second image below shows signal coverage if I transmit at 50watts and the receiving station has a raised antenna at least 10 meters high.  Again, in this scenerio the green areas are greater signal strenth at s4 and higher.
