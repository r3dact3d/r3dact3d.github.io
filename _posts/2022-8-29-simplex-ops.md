I'm also able to work from home currently and with gas prices almost $4 a gallon and high temps breaking records, portable and mobile operations are minimal.  Also, generally I just enjoy monitoring VHF/UHF national calling frequencies.

I decided to research my signal coverage and found Radio Mobile Online by ve2dbe and plugged in my antenna information.

Green is > S4
