Thanks to Dave over at (https://dkalaluhi.github.io) for opening my eyes to this simple-ish blog method using github and Jekyll.

My goal here is to migrate my previous 2 blogs (https://trizsolo.wordpress.com) and (http://redacted.site) into this blog.  I don't plan on bringing over every single post, but I do plan on pulling over my favorites and the posts that got alot of hits over the years.  Eventually, I will digress both those sites. 

I look forward to enhancing the blog experience here for both myself and you the reader using Jekyll and other themes I can find!
