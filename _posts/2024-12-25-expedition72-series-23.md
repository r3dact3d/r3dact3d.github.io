## ðŸ›  Setup 

A local area ham shared the anniversary and exercise on a Facebook group, and it caught my interest. Recently, I had experimented with satellite operations, specifically attempting to use the ISS as a digipeater to transmit my APRS beacon.

I already had the knowledge and experience of tracking the ISS and other Satellites. Now, I just needed to learn how to receive and decode SSTV images.  

The idea that I can get images from space with just an RF signal and some decode software that can potentially run on portable power intrigued me. This anniversary exercise takes place over a week, with the ISS transmitting several different images from space.

Hereâ€™s the setup I used for this project:

### Portable Setup:
- **VHF Handy Talky**: Tuned to 145.800 MHz
- **Audio Cable**: Connects radio to laptop
- **USB Audio Device**: Might not be neeed, but I had it and used it
- **Windows Laptop**: Running MMSSTV software
- **Antennas**: 10-element 2-meter yagi & roll-up j-pole
