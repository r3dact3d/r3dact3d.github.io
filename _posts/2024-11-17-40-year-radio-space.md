## ðŸ›  [Section 1: Setup or Context]

A local area ham shared the anniversary and excerise on a Facebook group and it caught my interest, because recently I had experimented with satellite operations and specifically attempting to use the ISS as a digipeater to transmit my APRS beacon.  So, I already had the knowledge and experience of tracking the ISS and other Satellites, now I just need to learn how to recieve and decode SSTV images, which is something I had heard about, but never attempte before.  Finally, the idea that I can get images from space with just RF signal and some decode software that potentially can be run from portable power, which is what I'll be attempting, seems like a potentially important skill to posess.  This anniversary excercise will take place for a week with the ISS sending a several different images from space.

### ðŸ“ˆ [Section 2: Analysis or Results]

This anniversary excercise is taking place for a week with the ISS sending a several different images from space.

#### SSTV ISS Operations:
**Portable Setup**
- VHF handy talky set to frequency 145.800 
- Audio cable and audio USB
- Windows laptop with MMSSTV program
- 10 element 2-meter yagi & roll-up j-pole antennas

For the operations over the week, I captured SSTV images from the ISS from my QTH shop and also from portable location at Lake Whitney State Park about an hour from my QTH.
