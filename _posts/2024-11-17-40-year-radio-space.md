# ðŸ“¡ SSTV from Space

> *To celebrate the 40th Anniversary of Amateur Radio in Space I attempt to capture and decode SSTV images that are being transmitted from the ISS - here is what and how I did!*

## Quick Summary
**Main Topic**: Sharing the SSTV images I was able to decode from the ISS.  
**Key Features**: Share some tips, tricks, and lessons learned.  
**Outcome**: It's pictures... from space!

## ðŸ›  Setup 

A local area ham shared the anniversary and exercise on a Facebook group, and it caught my interest. Recently, I had experimented with satellite operations, specifically attempting to use the ISS as a digipeater to transmit my APRS beacon.

I already had the knowledge and experience of tracking the ISS and other Satellites. Now, I just needed to learn how to receive and decode SSTV images.  

The idea that I can get images from space with just an RF signal and some decode software that can potentially run on portable power intrigued me. This anniversary exercise takes place over a week, with the ISS transmitting several different images from space.

Hereâ€™s the setup I used for this project:

### Portable Setup:
- **VHF Handy Talky**: Tuned to 145.800 MHz
- **Audio Cable**: Connects radio to laptop
- **USB Audio Device**: Might not be neeed, but I had it and used it
- **Windows Laptop**: Running MMSSTV software
- **Antennas**: 10-element 2-meter yagi & roll-up j-pole

## ðŸ“ˆ Results

### Captured Images:
Here are the SSTV images I decoded during the exercise. These were received from both my QTH shop and a portable location at Lake Whitney State Park.

### ðŸŒŸ Highlights and Challenges

- **Highlights**:
  - Successfully decoded 8 images from two locations.
  - Portable setup worked using a simple j-pole antenna.
  - Yagi antenna recieved lower angle passes much better

- **Challenges**:
  - Required precise timing and aiming for optimal ISS passes.
  - Decoding accuracy varied based on environmental noise and signal strength.

## ðŸ§­ Conclusion and Next Steps

This was an incredibly rewarding experience. Capturing SSTV images from space using a modest setup highlighted the power of amateur radio and the joy of experimentation.  

For my next steps, I plan to:
- Enhance my portable setup with a lightweight tripod for better antenna aiming, and for use with working Satellites using other modes.
- Experiment with different SSTV decoding software and hardware to improve quality and attempt to transmit SSTV.
