My collection of strings to enhance google results.  Google is obviously an extremely powerful web crawler.  Learning some specific **keyboards** and **operators** will change the way this search engine will work for you.  There are already alot of sites our there that walk you thru some of the different ways to use google, but here I am just putting what I like to search for and some examples I found. 

Basically, the whole idea here is to start with something simple and continue to add to it in order to narrow the search results down to what you might otherwise not find.

To begin, I start with the **intitle** operator with a keyword and add one keyword with the **+** operator. 
```
intitle:”network security” + news
```
