## ðŸ›  [Low Power?  But, why?]

Let's be honest, with my knees, I am not peaking many summits.  So why build a low power qrp antenna? 

Well, because I still like to go on hikes and the lighter the better, plus I think it will help motivate me to continue practicing CW for field operations.

## ðŸ“ˆ [Building the QRP 49:1 EFHW Antenna]

Inspired by the excellent instructions provided by [K6ARK](https://k6ark.com/qrp-491-efhw-build-instructions/),
I decided to take on the challenge of picking up an iron to build a QRP End-Fed Half-Wave antenna. 

Here's a step-by-step recount of my progress, complete with photos.

### Step 1: Wind the transformer
The first step I did was wind the toroidal transformer as described in the documentation and pictured.
