Hi there! I'm a Red Hat Architect by day, working on supported and enterprise-level open-source software. But when I'm not automating infrastructure provisioning or evangelizing GitOps strategies, you can find me outdoors, gazing at the sky and promoting the art of amateur radio.

I've had a fascination with radios for as long as I can remember. Growing up, I used to listen to local police and emergency communications, which gave me a sense of security and connection to my surroundings. Over the years, I've also noticed the occasional car or truck with an amateur radio operator license plate, which sparked my curiosity.

But it wasn't until I discovered the benefits of amateur radio for off-road and overlanding communities that I truly became interested in the hobby. I was particularly drawn to APRS and its ability to send automatic beacons, providing another method of trackability in remote areas with zero cell phone service.

That led me to upgrade my mobile communications from a CB radio to a mobile amateur radio station with the Yaesu FTM-400xdr. I'm currently licensed as W5AWW-9 and love exploring the world of amateur radio.

So, welcome to my blog! I hope you'll enjoy reading about my experiences with Red Hat Architecture, open-source software, and amateur radio. Stay tuned for more posts, and don't hesitate to reach out if you have any questions or suggestions.
